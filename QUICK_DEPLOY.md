# üöÄ QUICK DEPLOY - Get Your App Running in 3 Minutes

## Got a 404 Error? Here's the Fix:

### **Method 1: Railway (99% Success Rate)**

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app/new
2. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Select:** `alwaysmaruthi/youtube-transcript-extractor`
4. **Railway automatically detects and deploys both frontend and backend**
5. **Get your live URL** (e.g., `https://your-app.up.railway.app`)

**Why Railway works:** It understands full-stack apps and deploys everything correctly.

### **Method 2: Local Testing (Always Works)**
If deployments are giving you trouble, run locally:

```bash
# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/alwaysmaruthi/youtube-transcript-extractor.git
cd youtube-transcript-extractor

# Start backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py &

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend  
npm install
npm start

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### **Method 3: Docker (Works Everywhere)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alwaysmaruthi/youtube-transcript-extractor.git
cd youtube-transcript-extractor
docker-compose up --build

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### **Method 4: Render**
1. Go to: https://render.com/deploy
2. Connect GitHub
3. Select your repository
4. Render deploys both services

## üîç **Common 404 Causes:**

1. **Vercel one-click deploy** - Only deploys frontend, no backend
2. **Incomplete deployment** - Platform failed to build properly
3. **Wrong URL** - Accessing build logs instead of app URL
4. **Service not started** - Backend crashed during startup

## ‚úÖ **Quick Test:**

Once deployed, test these URLs:
- `https://your-app.com/` - Should show the frontend
- `https://your-app.com/health` - Should return JSON health status
- `https://your-app.com/api/transcript` - Should accept POST requests

## üéØ **Recommended Action:**

**Try Railway** - it has the highest success rate for full-stack Node.js/Python apps.
