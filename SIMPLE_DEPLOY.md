# 🚀 Simplified Railway Deployment

## The Previous Error:
Railway had trouble with the complex Nixpacks configuration. Let's use a simpler approach.

## ✅ **New Simple Configuration:**

I've simplified the deployment to focus on **backend-only** deployment:

- `Procfile` - Uses gunicorn for production
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies 
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.9
- Removed complex Nixpacks configuration

## 🚂 **Deploy Backend to Railway:**

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app/new
2. **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. **Select:** `alwaysmaruthi/youtube-transcript-extractor`
4. **Railway should now detect this as a Python app and deploy successfully**

## 🎯 **What You'll Get:**

After deployment, you'll have a **working backend API** at something like:
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health` - Health check
- `https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/transcript` - Transcript extraction

## 📱 **Test Your Backend:**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app/health

# Test transcript extraction
curl -X POST https://your-app.up.railway.app/api/transcript \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQXAC9IVRw"}'
```

## 🖥️ **For the Frontend:**

### **Option 1: Use Local Frontend**
Run the frontend locally and point it to your Railway backend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
# Edit src/App.js line 18 to use your Railway URL
npm start
```

### **Option 2: Deploy Frontend to Vercel**
1. Deploy frontend separately to Vercel
2. Update the API URL to point to your Railway backend
3. Get a complete full-stack solution

### **Option 3: Use Postman/Curl**
Test the API directly using the curl commands above.

## 🔄 **Try Again:**

This simplified configuration should work much better with Railway. The deployment will be **backend-only**, but that's the core functionality you need for transcript extraction.
