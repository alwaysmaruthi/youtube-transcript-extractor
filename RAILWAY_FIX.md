# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Fix

## The Error You Saw:
```
Nixpacks was unable to generate a build plan for this app.
```

## âœ… FIXED! 

I've added the necessary configuration files to make Railway deployment work:

### **New Files Added:**
- `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to start the app
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies at root level
- `package.json` - Node.js configuration  
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration for Railway
- `railway.toml` - Railway-specific settings

### **Updated:**
- `backend/app.py` - Now reads PORT from environment variables

## ðŸš€ **Deploy Now (Should Work!):**

1. **Go to:** https://railway.app/new
2. **Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. **Select:** `alwaysmaruthi/youtube-transcript-extractor`
4. **Railway will now successfully build and deploy**

## ðŸ”§ **What Was Wrong:**
Railway's Nixpacks couldn't detect whether this was a Python app or Node.js app because both `frontend/` and `backend/` directories existed. The new configuration files tell Railway:

1. **This is primarily a Python Flask app** (backend)
2. **How to install dependencies** for both frontend and backend
3. **How to start the application** (`python app.py`)
4. **Which port to use** (Railway provides PORT environment variable)

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Result:**
After deployment, you should get:
- **Backend API** running on Railway's provided URL
- **Health check** at `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Transcript API** at `https://your-app.railway.app/api/transcript`

## ðŸ“± **Frontend Access:**
The current setup deploys the **backend API**. For the frontend, you have options:

### **Option A: Serve Frontend from Flask (Simple)**
The backend can serve the React build files (I can add this if needed).

### **Option B: Separate Frontend Deployment**
Deploy frontend separately to Vercel/Netlify and point it to your Railway backend URL.

## ðŸ”„ **Try Deploying Again:**
The repository is now configured for Railway. Try the deployment again - it should work this time!
